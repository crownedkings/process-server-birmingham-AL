README

Hello everyone, this is my first attempt to build a website using Rails, the technology is fairly unkown to me, but I have some programming background and I think I can do it. I am doing this for a [process server birmingham AL](http://spy4rent.com/) company.

I am doing mainly SEO and PPC, but I also can build sites, I know basic html and php. I'm on a Mac, which is supposed to make things easier.

Just wanted to let you know I'm around and ready to get to work. I'll ask questions in case there are problems, it's a lot easier than doing endless searches and wasting a lot of time.

It's great to be here, I'm excited to try this!
